            <h5>Most farm-related emissions come in the form of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Cattle belching (CH4) and the addition of natural or synthetic fertilizers and wastes to soils (N2O) represent the largest sources, making up 65 percent of agricultural emissions globally. </h5>
            <h5>Production of beef and cattle milk accounts for the majority of emissions, contributing 41% and 20%, respectively, of the sector’s emissions. Production of pig meat and poultry meat and eggs contribute 9% and 8%, respectively, of the sector’s emissions (Gerber et al. 2013).</h5>
            <h5>From 2012 to 2030, N2O emissions from agricultural soils are projected to increase by 3.8%, from 2,114 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent to 2,195 million tonnes, which corresponds to 38.1% of total agricultural emissions (FAO 2015)<h5>

            <h2>How it's linked to Global Warming</h2>
            <br>
            <h5>Agriculture needs an increasing amount of space alongside massive amounts of chemical fertilisers now that the demand for meat and its products has increased dramatically in developing countries. This is damaging forests, which in turn would be able to absorb CO2 and mitigate anthropic (man-made) emissions.).</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>A vicious cycle that makes agriculture both a victim (given the negative effects of global warming on food supply) and a perpetrator (one of the main causes of climate change.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>In addition the use of synthetic fertilizers contributes 13% to agricultural emissions worldwide. Rice paddy fields emit methane through decomposing organic matter in the fields and contribute 10% to agricultural emissions. Other agricultural activities, such as burning vegetation biomass and cultivating organic soils, emit lower amounts of GHGs.</h5>

            <h6>While methane doesn't linger as long in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, it is initially far more devastating to the climate because of how effectively it absorbs heat.</h6>
